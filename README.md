# Bogelr GH Edition
## Bogelr 2025 Update
# The html file is now Giter.html.
Beware, the browser is not actually a browser in fact the file is an html file, so you wont get the full experience of the apk at sites.google.com/view/bogelr/home, and the file is named bogle6.5.html randomly, i wont change it to bogelr4.0.html or bogelrPC.html, if you want to use the full experience of the APK just get a WSA related app. If you want to see other products in one website go to sites.google.com/view/bonlute. The html file is now Giter.html.




This is not actually an actual browser.
